Mochi are jibo robots that are there for the patients in nursing homes and other long-term care units. Mochi is there for emotional support by telling short stories and jokes when the patient is sad, shares photos of the patient's family as well as emails, alerts nurses of falls/emergencies, and also alerts the nurses what the patients need/request such as a shower, water, or food.

## Installation

Run ``` npm install ``` in both the ``` jibo ``` and ``` node ```

## Usage

Run npm start in the node directory to start the server.
